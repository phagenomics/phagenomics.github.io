Accomplished and energetic bioinformatics-trained biologist with a solid track of achievements in genomic and metagenomic research. Passionate and motivated, with an ample background in biological sciences, statistics, and scientific computing. Areas of expertise include next-generation sequencing analysis, genomics, microbiology, virus-host interactions, and molecular biology. 

I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Biology from the Tecnologico del Valle de Oaxaca (Oaxaca, Mexico), where I studied the germination process of cacti; did you know that seeds can tell if they are under shade by the ratio of [red:far-red](https://news.californialightworks.com/how-does-the-far-red-light-spectrum-affect-plants/) light they receive?

In 2008 I was selected as a [Fulbright Fellow](https://eca.state.gov/fulbright) at the University of Arizona where I received a Master's of Science degree studying the phylogenomics of T4-like viruses, we found that most of their [genes are passed down vertically](https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02704.x) just like macro-organisms!

I subsequently obtained a PhD degree from the University of Arizona in Molecular and Cellular Biology, where I studied genes and genomes of marine viruses; We uncovered the [genome architecture](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13459) of viruses, annotated [novel structural proteins](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/9/2436.short), and described their [distribution patterns](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/1261498.summary).

Currently at the University of Southern California I get to wear multiple hats (including my field work hat, see image); Research wise I'm still interested in virus-host interactions, I actively think on novel methodological techniques to link viruses to host from the [informatic](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/2/2/lqaa044/5861484) to wet-lab based methods, and the [long-term consequences](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0628-x) of virus-hosts ecological interactions.
